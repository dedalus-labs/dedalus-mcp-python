## Response Actions

Elicitation responses use a three-action model to clearly distinguish between different user actions:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "action": "accept", // or "decline" or "cancel"
    "content": {
      "propertyName": "value",
      "anotherProperty": 42
    }
  }
}
```

The three response actions are:

1. **Accept** (`action: "accept"`): User explicitly approved and submitted with data
   * The `content` field contains the submitted data matching the requested schema
   * Example: User clicked "Submit", "OK", "Confirm", etc.

2. **Decline** (`action: "decline"`): User explicitly declined the request
   * The `content` field is typically omitted
   * Example: User clicked "Reject", "Decline", "No", etc.

3. **Cancel** (`action: "cancel"`): User dismissed without making an explicit choice
   * The `content` field is typically omitted
   * Example: User closed the dialog, clicked outside, pressed Escape, etc.

Servers should handle each state appropriately:

* **Accept**: Process the submitted data
* **Decline**: Handle explicit decline (e.g., offer alternatives)
* **Cancel**: Handle dismissal (e.g., prompt again later)
