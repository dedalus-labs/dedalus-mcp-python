## Security Considerations

1. Servers **MUST NOT** request sensitive information through elicitation
2. Clients **SHOULD** implement user approval controls
3. Both parties **SHOULD** validate elicitation content against the provided schema
4. Clients **SHOULD** provide clear indication of which server is requesting information
5. Clients **SHOULD** allow users to decline elicitation requests at any time
6. Clients **SHOULD** implement rate limiting
7. Clients **SHOULD** present elicitation requests in a way that makes it clear what information is being requested and why
