The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way for servers to request additional
information from users through the client during interactions. This flow allows clients to
maintain control over user interactions and data sharing while enabling servers to gather
necessary information dynamically.
Servers request structured data from users with JSON schemas to validate responses.
