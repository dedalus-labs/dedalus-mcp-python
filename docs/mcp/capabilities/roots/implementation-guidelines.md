## Implementation Guidelines

1. Clients **SHOULD**:
   * Prompt users for consent before exposing roots to servers
   * Provide clear user interfaces for root management
   * Validate root accessibility before exposing
   * Monitor for root changes

2. Servers **SHOULD**:
   * Check for roots capability before usage
   * Handle root list changes gracefully
   * Respect root boundaries in operations
   * Cache root information appropriately
