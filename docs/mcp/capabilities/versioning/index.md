# Versioning
Source: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/versioning



The Model Context Protocol uses string-based version identifiers following the format
`YYYY-MM-DD`, to indicate the last date backwards incompatible changes were made.

<Info>
  The protocol version will *not* be incremented when the
  protocol is updated, as long as the changes maintain backwards compatibility. This allows
  for incremental improvements while preserving interoperability.
