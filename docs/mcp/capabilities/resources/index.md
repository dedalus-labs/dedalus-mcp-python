The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way for servers to expose
resources to clients. Resources allow servers to share data that provides context to
language models, such as files, database schemas, or application-specific information.
Each resource is uniquely identified by a
[URI](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986).
