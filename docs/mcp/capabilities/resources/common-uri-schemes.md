## Common URI Schemes

The protocol defines several standard URI schemes. This list not
exhaustive—implementations are always free to use additional, custom URI schemes.

### https\://

Used to represent a resource available on the web.

Servers **SHOULD** use this scheme only when the client is able to fetch and load the
resource directly from the web on its own—that is, it doesn’t need to read the resource
via the MCP server.

For other use cases, servers **SHOULD** prefer to use another URI scheme, or define a
custom one, even if the server will itself be downloading resource contents over the
internet.

### file://

Used to identify resources that behave like a filesystem. However, the resources do not
need to map to an actual physical filesystem.

MCP servers **MAY** identify file:// resources with an
[XDG MIME type](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/shared-mime-info-spec/0.14/ar01s02.html#id-1.3.14),
like `inode/directory`, to represent non-regular files (such as directories) that don’t
otherwise have a standard MIME type.

### git://

Git version control integration.

### Custom URI Schemes

Custom URI schemes **MUST** be in accordance with [RFC3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986),
taking the above guidance in to account.
