## Timing Considerations

Due to network latency, cancellation notifications may arrive after request processing
has completed, and potentially after a response has already been sent.

Both parties **MUST** handle these race conditions gracefully:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
   participant Client
   participant Server

   Client->>Server: Request (ID: 123)
   Note over Server: Processing starts
   Client--)Server: notifications/cancelled (ID: 123)
   alt
      Note over Server: Processing may have<br/>completed before<br/>cancellation arrives
   else If not completed
      Note over Server: Stop processing
   end
```
