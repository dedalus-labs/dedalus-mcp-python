## Implementation Considerations

* Implementations **SHOULD** periodically issue pings to detect connection health
* The frequency of pings **SHOULD** be configurable
* Timeouts **SHOULD** be appropriate for the network environment
* Excessive pinging **SHOULD** be avoided to reduce network overhead
