The Model Context Protocol (MCP) follows a client-host-server architecture where each
host can run multiple client instances. This architecture enables users to integrate AI
capabilities across applications while maintaining clear security boundaries and
isolating concerns. Built on JSON-RPC, MCP provides a stateful session protocol focused
on context exchange and sampling coordination between clients and servers.
