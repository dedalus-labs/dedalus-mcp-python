## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

### Claude Desktop

Download and install [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) for your operating system. Claude Desktop is currently available for macOS and Windows. Linux support is coming soon.

If you already have Claude Desktop installed, verify you're running the latest version by clicking the Claude menu and selecting "Check for Updates..."

### Node.js

The Filesystem Server and many other MCP servers require Node.js to run. Verify your Node.js installation by opening a terminal or command prompt and running:

```bash
node --version
```

If Node.js is not installed, download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). We recommend the LTS (Long Term Support) version for stability.
