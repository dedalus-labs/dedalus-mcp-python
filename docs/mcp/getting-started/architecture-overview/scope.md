## Scope

The Model Context Protocol includes the following projects:

* [MCP Specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/latest): A specification of MCP that outlines the implementation requirements for clients and servers.
* [MCP SDKs](/docs/sdk): SDKs for different programming languages that implement MCP.
* **MCP Development Tools**: Tools for developing MCP servers and clients, including the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector)
* [MCP Reference Server Implementations](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers): Reference implementations of MCP servers.

<Note>
  MCP focuses solely on the protocol for context exchange—it does not dictate
  how AI applications use LLMs or manage the provided context.
