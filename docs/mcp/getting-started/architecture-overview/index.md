# Architecture overview
Source: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/architecture



This overview of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) discusses its [scope](scope.md#scope) and [core concepts](concepts-of-mcp.md#concepts-of-mcp), and provides an [example](example.md#example) demonstrating each core concept.

Because MCP SDKs abstract away many concerns, most developers will likely find the [data layer protocol](#data-layer-protocol) section to be the most useful. It discusses how MCP servers can provide context to an AI application.

For specific implementation details, please refer to the documentation for your [language-specific SDK](/docs/sdk).
