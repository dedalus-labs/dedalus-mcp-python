Learn how to connect Claude to remote MCP servers and extend its capabilities with internet-hosted tools and data sources

Remote MCP servers extend AI applications' capabilities beyond your local environment, providing access to internet-hosted tools, services, and data sources. By connecting to remote MCP servers, you transform AI assistants from helpful tools into informed teammates capable of handling complex, multi-step projects with real-time access to external resources.

Many clients now support remote MCP servers, enabling a wide range of integration possibilities. This guide demonstrates how to connect to remote MCP servers using [Claude](https://claude.ai/) as an example, one of the [many clients that support MCP](/clients). While we focus on Claude's implementation through Custom Connectors, the concepts apply broadly to other MCP-compatible clients.
