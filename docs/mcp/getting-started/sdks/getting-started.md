## Getting Started

Each SDK provides the same functionality but follows the idioms and best practices of its language. All SDKs support:

* Creating MCP servers that expose tools, resources, and prompts
* Building MCP clients that can connect to any MCP server
* Local and remote transport protocols
* Protocol compliance with type safety

Visit the SDK page for your chosen language to find installation instructions, documentation, and examples.
