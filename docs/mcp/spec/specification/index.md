[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) is an open protocol that
enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and
tools. Whether you're building an AI-powered IDE, enhancing a chat interface, or creating
custom AI workflows, MCP provides a standardized way to connect LLMs with the context
they need.

This specification defines the authoritative protocol requirements, based on the
TypeScript schema in
[schema.ts](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/blob/main/schema/2025-06-18/schema.ts).
