## Overview

MCP provides a standardized way for applications to:

* Share contextual information with language models
* Expose tools and capabilities to AI systems
* Build composable integrations and workflows

The protocol uses [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) 2.0 messages to establish
communication between:

* **Hosts**: LLM applications that initiate connections
* **Clients**: Connectors within the host application
* **Servers**: Services that provide context and capabilities

MCP takes some inspiration from the
[Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/), which
standardizes how to add support for programming languages across a whole ecosystem of
development tools. In a similar way, MCP standardizes how to integrate additional context
and tools into the ecosystem of AI applications.
