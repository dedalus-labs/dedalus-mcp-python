## What is a SEP?

SEP stands for Specification Enhancement Proposal. A SEP is a design document providing information to the MCP community, or describing a new feature for the Model Context Protocol or its processes or environment. The SEP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.

We intend SEPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing major new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into MCP. The SEP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

Because the SEPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository (GitHub Issues), their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.
