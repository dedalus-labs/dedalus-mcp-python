## Reporting SEP Bugs, or Submitting SEP Updates

How you report a bug, or submit a SEP update depends on several factors, such as the maturity of the SEP, the preferences of the SEP author, and the nature of your comments. For SEPs not yet reaching `final` state, it's probably best to send your comments and changes directly to the SEP author. Once SEP is finalized, you may want to submit corrections as a GitHub comment on the issue or pull request to the reference implementation.
