## Transferring SEP Ownership

It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of SEPs to a new SEP author. In general, we'd like to retain the original author as a co-author of the transferred SEP, but that's really up to the original author. A good reason to transfer ownership is because the original author no longer has the time or interest in updating it or following through with the SEP process, or has fallen off the face of the 'net (i.e. is unreachable or not responding to email). A bad reason to transfer ownership is because you don't agree with the direction of the SEP. We try to build consensus around a SEP, but if that's not possible, you can always submit a competing SEP.
