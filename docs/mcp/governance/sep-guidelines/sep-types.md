## SEP Types

There are three kinds of SEP:

1. **Standards Track** SEP describes a new feature or implementation for the Model Context Protocol. It may also describe an interoperability standard that will be supported outside the core protocol specification.
2. **Informational** SEP describes a Model Context Protocol design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the MCP community, but does not propose a new feature. Informational SEPs do not necessarily represent an MCP community consensus or recommendation.
3. **Process** SEP describes a process surrounding MCP, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process SEPs are like Standards Track SEPs but apply to areas other than the MCP protocol itself.
