## Authentication and Security

We're evolving our authorization and security resources to improve user safety and provide a better developer experience:

* **Guides and Best Practices**: documenting specifics about deploying MCP securely in the form of guides and best practices to help developers avoid common pitfalls.
* **Alternatives to Dynamic Client Registration (DCR)**: exploring alternatives to DCR, attempting to address operational challenges while preserving a smooth user experience.
* **Fine-grained Authorization**: developing mechanisms and guidelines for primitive authorization for sensitive actions
* **Enterprise Managed Authorization**: adding the capability for enterprises to simplify MCP server authorization with the help of Single Sign-On (SSO)
* **Secure Authorization Elicitation**: enable developers to integrate secure authorization flows for downstream APIs outside the main MCP server authorization
