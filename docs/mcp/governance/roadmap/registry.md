## Registry

For MCP to reach its full potential, we need streamlined ways to distribute and discover MCP servers.

We plan to develop an [**MCP Registry**](https://github.com/orgs/modelcontextprotocol/discussions/159) that will enable centralized server discovery and metadata. This registry will primarily function as an API layer that third-party marketplaces and discovery services can build upon.
