## Introduction

The goal of the Model Context Protocol open source project (the "Project") is to develop a universal standard for model-to-world interactions, including enabling LLMs and agents to seamlessly connect with and utilize external data sources and tools. The purpose of this Antitrust Policy (the "Policy") is to avoid antitrust risks in carrying out this pro-competitive mission.

Participants in and contributors to the Project (collectively, "participants") will use their best reasonable efforts to comply in all respects with all applicable state and federal antitrust and trade regulation laws, and applicable antitrust/competition laws of other countries (collectively, the "Antitrust Laws").

The goal of Antitrust Laws is to encourage vigorous competition. Nothing in this Policy prohibits or limits the ability of participants to make, sell or use any product, or otherwise to compete in the marketplace. This Policy provides general guidance on compliance with Antitrust Law. Participants should contact their respective legal counsel to address specific questions.

This Policy is conservative and is intended to promote compliance with the Antitrust Laws, not to create duties or obligations beyond what the Antitrust Laws actually require. In the event of any inconsistency between this Policy and the Antitrust Laws, the Antitrust Laws preempt and control.
